I am currently a faculty member at the School of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences. My long-term research focuses on image processing, detection and recognition technologies and their applications in the power industry. In recent years, I have presided over 2 provincial and ministerial-level scientific research projects, published more than 10 academic papers in prestigious journals such as the IEEE Transactions series, and a single research paper published as the first author has received over 120 independent citations. The methods I proposed have been adopted as academic comparison benchmarks by multiple research groups, garnering extensive positive citations and recognition. I also serve as a peer reviewer for several authoritative SCI-indexed journals.

我目前是重庆文理学院电气工程学院的教师。长期聚焦图像处理、检测与识别技术及其在电力行业的应用研究，近年来主持省部级科研项目2项，在IEEE Trans.系列汇刊等学术期刊发表论文10余篇，以第一作者发表的研究性论文单篇最高他引120余次，所提出的方法被多个课题组列为学术对比基准，获得了广泛正面引用与评价。兼任多个权威SCI期刊的同行评审专家。

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
