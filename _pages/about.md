I am currently a faculty member at the School of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences.  

My long-term research focuses on multimodal image processing, perception and analysis, as well as their applications in industrial visual inspection.
I have published more than 10 papers in academic journals such as the IEEE Transactions series.
A single research paper published as the first author has received over 120 non-self citations, and our method has been adopted as an academic comparison benchmark by multiple research groups, garnering extensive positive citations and evaluations.
I also serve as a peer reviewer for several authoritative SCI journals.

我目前是重庆文理学院电气工程学院的教师。  

长期聚焦多模态图像处理、感知与分析及其在工业视觉检测中的应用研究，先后主持重庆市自然科学基金面上项目、重庆市教委科研项目青年项目等省部级科研项目2项，在IEEE Trans.系列汇刊等学术期刊发表论文10余篇，以第一作者发表的研究性论文单篇最高他引120余次，所提出的方法被多个课题组列为学术对比基准，获得了广泛正面引用与评价。兼任多个权威SCI期刊的同行评审专家。
