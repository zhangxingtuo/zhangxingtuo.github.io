I am currently a faculty member at the School of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences. My long-term research focuses on image processing, detection and recognition technologies and their applications in the power industry. In recent years, I have presided over 2 provincial and ministerial-level scientific research projects, published more than 10 academic papers in prestigious journals such as the IEEE Transactions series, and a single research paper published as the first author has received over 120 independent citations. The methods I proposed have been adopted as academic comparison benchmarks by multiple research groups, garnering extensive positive citations and recognition. I also serve as a peer reviewer for several authoritative SCI-indexed journals.

我目前是重庆文理学院电气工程学院的教师。长期聚焦图像处理、检测与识别技术及其在电力行业的应用研究，近年来主持省部级科研项目2项，在IEEE Trans.系列汇刊等学术期刊发表论文10余篇，以第一作者发表的研究性论文单篇最高他引120余次，所提出的方法被多个课题组列为学术对比基准，获得了广泛正面引用与评价。兼任多个权威SCI期刊的同行评审专家。
